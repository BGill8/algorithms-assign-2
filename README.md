HOW TO RUN CODE:
python solution.py

(We hard coded the 3 files: imp2input.txt, imp2output.txt, and imp2cost.txt as variables under line 87-89 of solution.py.
You can change them if needed by if the input and other files are already have these names, then running just python solution.py will work.

To check cost results, run:
 python check_cost.py -c imp2cost.txt -o imp2output_our.txt -s imp2output.txt


In case you want to see how random inputs are generated, just run:
pythhon create_inputs.py
